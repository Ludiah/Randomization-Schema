Repository Description: This project generates unique patient identifiers by assigning a string of characters and numbers to track patients and their treatment status. The format "AAA, BBB..." represents sequential blocks, while "01, 02, 03..." represents patient numbers. A "T" or "C" suffix is appended to designate whether the patient is in the treatment or control group, randomly assigned to ensure unbiased classification. This system facilitates efficient patient identification and status tracking for clinical trials or studies.
